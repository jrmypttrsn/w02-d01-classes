#:dog: Dogs, :rabbit: Rabbits, and :suspect: Evil Henchpersons: 3 Classes

The following are three classes of things that exist in the world:

* Dogs  
* Rabbits  
* Evil Henchpersons

These classes all have attributes pertaining to them that will be explained below.

**Dog Class**

The `Dog` class contains the following attributes:

* `name`: a string representing the name of the dog
* `age`: an integer representing the age of the dog
* `species`: a string representing the species of the dog
* `gender`: a string representing the gender of the dog
* `tail`: a string representing the kind of tail the dog has
* `eyes`: an integer representing how many eyes the dog has
* `ears`: an integer representing how many ears the dog has
* `license`: an integer representing the license number of the dog
* `shots`: a boolean value representing whether the dogs is up to date on their shots
* `rabbits killed`: an integer representing the number of rabbits the dog has killed

**Rabbit Class**

The `Rabbit` class contains the following attributes:

* `name`: a string representing the name of the rabbit
* `age`: an integer representing the age of the rabbit
* `species`: a string representing the species of the rabbit
* `gender`: a string representing the gender of the rabbit
* `legs`: a string representing the gender of the rabbit
* `eyes`: an integer representing how many eyes the rabbit has
* `ears`: a string representing how many ears the rabbit has
* `children`: an integer representing how many children the rabbit has

**Evil Henchperson Class**

The `EvilHenchperson` class contains the following attributes:

* `name`: a string representing the name of the henchperson
* `age`: an integer representing the age of the henchperson
* `gender`: a string representing the gender of the henchperson
* `eyes`: an integer representing how many eyes the henchperson has
* `ears`: a string representing how many ears the henchperson has
* `weapon`: a string representing the weapon the henchperson uses
* `depravity`: an integer representing the degree to which the henchperson is evil (1 being mean,100 being the physical embodiment of pure evil)
* `dogs stolen`: an integer representing the number of dogs the henchperson has stolen


*Eventually they will interact with each other in that the dogs want to catch and kill the rabbits, the henchpersons want to steal the dogs, and the rabbits just want to eat from the garden (a new class to be created because I have so much time).*
